# NumPy Notebook

Welcome to my Jupyter Notebook on **NumPy**! ðŸ““  
This project documents my hands-on learning experience with NumPy â€” Pythonâ€™s powerful library for numerical computing. The notebook is packed with practical examples, clear explanations, and useful tricks.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Covered

- Array creation and types
- Array operations & broadcasting
- Indexing, slicing, and masking
- Math & statistical functions
- Linear algebra with `numpy.linalg`
- Random number generation
- Common pitfalls & pro tips

## ðŸš€ How to Run

To explore the notebook on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Evertte/numpy-notebook.git
   cd numpy-notebook
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy notebook
   ```

3. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `numpy_practice.ipynb` (or whatever your file is named)

## ðŸ™Œ Why This Exists

I created this notebook to:

- Reinforce my understanding of NumPy
- Build a solid reference I can revisit
- Share with others who are also learning
